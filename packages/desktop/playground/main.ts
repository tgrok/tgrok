// This file is a placeholder for web build.
// We will replace the web build with the contents in www
// TODO: don't build web from the beginning.
// I tried to remove entryPoints from webpack, but it will
// throw exceptions. We can also add a parameter to skip vue build
// to `vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder` to achieve this,
// but it will take too much time, and it doesn't worth.
// let's just remove them before packaging.
